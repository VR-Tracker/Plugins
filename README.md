As of now a new version of the plugin is available for **Tag V2 and over only**. This version is completely new and not compatible with previous versions. If you have a previous version in your project, please delete the *VR Tracker* folder before importing the new plugin. Finally the Plugin can be found on the link below along with an extensive documentation :

## Getting Started

Choose the selected SDK for the development platform that you are currently using.
###Note We are currently providing just the SDK for Unity, UE4 will come soon...
The different SDK will enable your application to communicate with VR Tracker system, getting all the different information you need. Find more detailed information on our [wiki](https://github.com/VR-Tracker/Plugins/wiki)

### Prerequisites

Unity SDK
* Install Unity 2017 or later (The SDK should work on 5.6, as it has been first developed on it)

### Choose your networking solution

Providing multiplayer experience implies to network all the different information to all the users. You can either choose to use your own networking system, or base your development on one of the networking solution that already exist.
In Unity, we provide directly an version of our SDK with UNET, (Photon will come soon...). If you want to use your own networking, you can just get the files and use them in your current networking system. If you need any help, send us an email at support@vrtracker.xyz.
